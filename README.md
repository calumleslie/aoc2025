# Advent of Code 2025 solutions

Apparently last year wasn't enough of a distraction so this year I'm writing
Rust, something I have not done in some time.

Days are dispatched from the main method, `cargo run day1` etc. should do the job.

Input files are expected in a directory `inputs` which is filtered out per
[AOC's guidance on redistribution](redist).
